The client, Robin, wanted to utilize web-scraping to pull in data from various space-related sites so that she could have something to present to NASA and other astrophiles. Ideally, they'd like her work and hire her for an internship.
Her site included tools from BeautifulSoup, Splinter, Bootstrap, etc. that pulled in and displayed information being stored in a MongoDB.
